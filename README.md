## About
AIParkinScan (AIPS) is an artifical intelligence software used for the diangosis of Parkinson's disease. It asks for the input of a drawing and an audio file, which is  evaluated for inconsistency in the drawing and voice that is caused by micrographia or voice tremors. If inconsistency is detected, it is a strong indcation of Parkinson's, as tremors and micrographia are common symptoms of Parkinson's.

Our aim is to develop an easy, accuracte, and efficent way to diagnosis Parkinson's disease. There are currently limited and unoffical tests for Parkinson's, and even after diagnosis, symptoms need to be carefully monitored. Using our software, diagnosis of Parkinson's becomes widely available to all, and can also be used for tracking of symptom progression.
